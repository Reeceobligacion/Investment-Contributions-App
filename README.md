# Investment Contributions Desktop Application

I wanted to track and summarize the investment contributions I've made in various brokerages, so I built a simple contributions management gui.

The Front-End is written in Tkinter and SQLite is used as the embedded database.

Application is designed using object-oriented concepts and MVC pattern.

### Usage
------------
1. Download and clone repo
2. 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Run main.py
4. Voila!
